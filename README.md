## 📝 Description

**Vigilance Web Security Analyzer** is a comprehensive client-side web application designed to scan and analyze security vulnerabilities in software components and web URLs. The application integrates with the NVD (National Vulnerability Database) API to fetch real-time CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) data and provides detailed security reports with CVSS scoring, mitigation strategies, and historical tracking.

The application offers two scanning modes:
1. **Component Scan**: Analyzes software components and versions for known CVEs using the NVD API
2. **URL Scan**: Performs mock security analysis on target URLs for common web vulnerabilities

### Key Highlights

- 🔍 **Real-time CVE Lookup**: Fetches actual vulnerability data from the NVD database
- 📊 **Interactive Dashboard**: Visual representation of vulnerabilities with severity charts and statistics
- 🎨 **Modern UI/UX**: Dark/Light theme support with responsive design
- 📈 **Historical Tracking**: Maintains a history of previous scans using localStorage
- 📥 **Export Reports**: Download comprehensive security reports in text format
- 🖨️ **Print Support**: Professional print layouts for reports
- 🚀 **Zero Configuration**: Pure client-side application, no backend required
